HOW TO INSTALL:

1. UNZIP DYSLEXIC-CROSSHAIR IN YOUR "customs" FOLDER.
   (Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom)

   If there isn't a customs folder, create one.

2. DONE. JUST PLAY ALREADY. SCALLYWAG.

This neato crosshair was made by a dyslexic (me) for a dyslexic (you?) but has also been proven to improve the aim of players with normal vision.
I probably sent you this link because you asked me "wtf is that crosshair".
